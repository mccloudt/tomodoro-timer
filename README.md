# Tomodoro Timer
A basic timer project in React to help with learning. You can add multiple timers that are individually tracked with their own breaks and work durations. 

# Todo
Complete the actual timer functionality. Got the layout/containment of components completed right now, so all that's left is to add the timer functionality, pause button, stop completely button.

## Future plans 
A timer expiring can then trigger a different timer to initiate - This could be extremely useful for time-managing a workflow.
