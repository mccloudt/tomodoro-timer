# Tomodoro Timer
A basic timer project in React to help with learning. You can add multiple timers that are individually tracked with their own breaks and work durations. 

## Future plans 
A timer expiring can then trigger a different timer to initiate - This could be extremely useful for time-managing a workflow.
